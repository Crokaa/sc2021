This project was done by 3 people (me included) in the 3rd year of University.

It was a portuguese Java version of the Instagram app called SeiTchiz. The project was focused towards security. So besides the posting photos, liking photos, talking privately to people we had to focus on communications using TLS sockets. 

To simplify things we assumed every user had access to every public key (server and users)
